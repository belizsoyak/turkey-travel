# Project Name: Turkey Travel Hub

## Project Description
Turkey travel hub is a curated travel web app for exploring Turkey through local cuisine, music, and destinations. Users choose a city and a mood, and receive a custom travel experience — complete with food recommendations, Spotify music, cultural sites, and interactive maps. With this app, I hope to familiarize people around me with the Turkish culture and hopefully have some friends use it before visiting my home country!
